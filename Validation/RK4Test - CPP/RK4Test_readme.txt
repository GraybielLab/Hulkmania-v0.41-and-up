This program was developed to test the RK4 algorithm. It calls the algorithm with a few sets of predefined parameters, and prints the output values to the screen. These values were then compared with the output of a C# implementation of the same algorithm, to check for implementation errors (since 2 people developed both implementations separately, it's unlikely that the same implementation mistakes were made twice).
